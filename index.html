			<p>A disc jockey, more commonly abbreviated as DJ, is a person who hosts recorded music for an audience. Most common types of DJs include radio DJs, club DJs, who perform at a nightclub or music festival and turntablists who use record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the "disc" in "disc jockey" referred to vinyl records, but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who mix music from other recording media such as cassettes, CDs or digital audio files on a CDJ or a laptop. The title "DJ" is often used by DJs in front of their real names, adopted pseudonyms, or stage names.</p><br>
			<p>DJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and mix them together to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves aligning the beats of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized DJ mixers, small audio mixers with crossfader and cue functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in headphones and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a DJ controller device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a microphone to speak to the audience; effects units such as reverb to create sound effects and electronic musical instruments such as drum machines and synthesizers.</p>

The art of Dj-ing is a skill that is gained over many many years. Before you have even decided that you want to learn how to DJ it’s likely you have been honing your skills already. Making playlists, setting the mood, researching artists you like, reading blogs, watching for releases on your favourite record label, putting together youtube playlists, and then organising your music library (again!).

All of these are vital skills that you’ll need as you dive further down the rabbit hole. If you find yourself already doing all of these activities then you have a strong base for why you might want to be a DJ. Your primary job as a DJ will be setting the mood and vibe. SO…

Are you putting on dinner music? Finding tunes to run to? Making mixtape for the babe of your dreams? These are all practices in creating a mood and if you are already doing this naturally –  maybe DJing is for you.</p>
<br>
 
<p>The first step in learning how to DJ is too decide what type of DJ you want to be;

The Club DJ
Each club has a different feel, reputation, and audience… which also means that clubs vary in what they expect from their musical selection. Typically, the job of the resident DJ at a night club is to maintain a moving dance floor. Often, club DJs will perform long blends (transitions) between songs, or some other trickery to keep people’s feet moving.

This DJ must know how to ramp the energy up and down, and maintain a balance between an active dance floor, and a busy bar.

The Performer (Turntablist)
People go to see this DJ because of who they are, their reputation, and what people think they can do behind the decks. Their mixes are displays of raw skill, impressive tricks, and clever transitions.

The “exhibitionist” DJs fit here, such as turntablists (focus on cutting and scratching), “controllerists”, and other types of live performers. DMC DJ’s are performers.

The Mobile DJ
These are the ones who perform at your wedding, set the tone for your corporate event, or provide a memorable prom party.

Often the entrepreneurial type, mobile DJs have a lot of things to keep track of. In some cases, they are solely responsible for the setup and teardown of equipment, planning the show, managing the crowd, and making any announcements.

This kind of DJ often needs to be comfortable with taking requests (and sometimes even entire playlists), speaking into a microphone, and investing in sound equipment.

The Radio DJ
The concept of the DJ owes it’s origins to radio.</p>

			<p>As music technology has progressed, DJs have adopted different types of equipment to play and mix music, all of which are still commonly used. Traditionally, DJs used two turntables plugged into a DJ mixer to mix music on vinyl records. As compact discs became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as CDJs were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from USB flash drives or SD cards in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable laptop, tablet, and smartphone computers, DJs began using software together with specialized sound cards and DJ controller hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.</p><br>
			<p> With this said you can then decide what your budget is and what type of equipment you would like to buy and the best software you want to Dj and practise on.</p>
